If you are going to upload your code to this repository, please follow these guidelines below:

1. Place your code in `code` directory.

   Use the name of this problem shown in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) as the subfolder name. For example, to upload your solution for [Problem 1](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/), you need to create a new folder called `1. Two Sum` , and then put your code to `./code/1. Two Sum`

2. make a link to your code in *Readme* file

   Please use a link directly to your code file so that others can easily access your code from the homepage. The link should be a relative path from the root of the project to your code file. For example, for *Problem 14*, the link looks like `code/14.%20Longest%20Common%20Prefix/longestCommonPrefix_14.java`. Notice that you should replace the character space ` ` with `%20` in URL.
